## Hi there üëã

I'm a master CS student, who is passionate about creating things that make a positive impact on people's lives.

## Projects:

### AI Classification Model	
Developed a Streamlit-based AI web application that identifies fruits and vegetables from user-uploaded images using a CNN architecture (MobileNetV2) which classify foods as lipedema-safe or not based on medical guidelines.

## Hackathon Projects
HackDavis 2025 - Won Best Assistive Technology Award	 April 2025
Happi - Full Stack WebApp	
Developed a full-stack web app that builds on existing research by using diagnostic information from a digital SAGE exam and storing user data to help identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease. 
I mainly worked on backend where I used Firebase for user authentication and MongoDB Atlas to store and retrieve user data for real-time visualizations.

UC Berkeley AI Hackathon 2025 - CareMap
Worked on a project called CareMap which will find local help fast by entering a ZIP code and choosing preferences (like ID required, walk-ins welcome, multilingual staff, etc.) Using  AI-generated summary (via Claude 3) explaining the best matches.Users will be able to view results visually on a live interactive map. Its possible to chat with an AI to ask questions like ‚ÄúWhere can I get food tonight?‚Äù We prioritize accessibility, urgency, and clarity to serve those who need help the most.
